# DOM Manipulation Exercise

Use JavaScript to manipulate the contents of a webpage.

## Objectives

  1. Learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
  * Optionally gain exposure to using the jQuery library to manipulate the DOM.
  * Optionally gain exposure to using the D3 library to manipulate the DOM.

## Prerequisites

  + [JavaScript Language Overview](/notes/javascript/notes.md)
  + [DOM Overview](/notes/javascript/document-object-model.md)

## Instructions

### Page-loading

Observe lessons from https://prof-rossetti.github.io/js-dom-fundamentals/page-loading.html:

  + Compare the source code to messages logged to the browser's console.

### Selections

Observe lessons from https://prof-rossetti.github.io/js-dom-fundamentals/selections.html:

  + Use JavaScript to programmatically select each element on the page.
  + Use JavaScript to select all child elements belonging to the `select#animal-selector` element.
  + Use JavaScript to identify the name of the currently-selected animal.

### Events

#### Event-listening

Observe lessons from https://prof-rossetti.github.io/js-dom-fundamentals/event-listening.html:

  + Use JavaScript to log a message or display an alert any time the button element is clicked.
  + Log a message or display an alert any time the select element is changed. Include the name of the currently-selected animal in the contents of the message/alert.

### DOM Manipulation

Observe lessons from https://prof-rossetti.github.io/js-dom-fundamentals/dom-manipulation.html:

  + Use JavaScript to change the contents of the message displayed on the page.
  + Use JavaScript to add and remove elements from the page. Try adding elements of many kinds. Try adding elements nested inside other elements.

  > ### Further Exploration
  >
  > Repeat this exercise two more times. On the first repetition, use jQuery instead of vanilla JavaScript to perform the DOM manipulations. On the second repetition, use D3 library to perform the DOM manipulations.
