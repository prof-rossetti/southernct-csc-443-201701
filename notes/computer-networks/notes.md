# Computer Networks

A **computer network** is a "system (of) connect(ed) computers and (computer hardware)"
 which use "communications media" to transmit data
  to other members in the network.

## Network Sizes

Computer networks are often described in terms of size:

network size | description | example(s)
--- | --- | ---
Personal Area Network (PAN) | Two ore more devices in a very limited geographical region, usually within the same room | a bluetooth connection between headphones and mobile phone
Local Area Network (LAN) | "two or more devices in a limited geographical region, usually within the same building" | a home WiFi network
Wide Area Network (WAN) | "covers a large geographic region; typically connects multiple LANs" | a university network (e.g. GWireless); the Internet

The **Internet** is a very very large WAN computer network. It is a network of networks.

## Network Communications Media

**Communications media** refer to the pathways, or methods, by which data are transmitted.
 Cable media transmit information over physical wires or cables, whereas broadcast media transmit information through electromagnetic waves.

### Cable Media

Cable media are described by their physical composition and each have advantages and disadvantages in terms of capability and cost.

**Twisted pair wire** is a medium comprised of "twisted copper wires" which is commonly used to "transmit business telephone communications".
 Twisted-pair wire is inexpensive, but "slow ... and subject to (intrusion and) interference."

**Coaxial cable** is a medium comprised of "insulated copper wire"
 and is commonly used to "transmit high-speed data traffic and television signals". Cable is "less susceptible to interference" but "more expensive and harder to work with" than twisted-pair wire.

**Fiber-optic cable** is a medium comprised of "thin ... glass fibers that transmit information via light pulses generated by lasers". Fiber provides a significant increase in bandwidth and security, but may involve great up-front investment costs, and is "harder to work with" than other cable media.

### Broadcast Media

 + Bluetooth
 + WiFi
 + Wireless Mesh Networks
 + Cellular radio
 + Satellite radio
 + Wireless Broadband

## Network Architecture

Within the context of the Internet, computers connect to each other using Client/Server Architecture. The role of the **client** computer is to request information, whereas the responsibility of the **server** is to fulfill those requests.

Just as a telephone number serves to uniquely identify a device's connection to a cellular network, an IP Address uniquely identifies a computer's connection to the Internet.

### Lifecycle of a Network Request

## Network Protocols

Computers connected to the Internet communicate according to a "common set of rules and procedures", or protocols.

abbreviation | name | description
--- | --- | ---
[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)  | Hyper Text Transfer Protocol | The foundation protocol for the Internet.
[HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)  | Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol | A widely-used Internet protocol for secure network communication over HTTP within a connection encrypted by SSL/TLS.
[SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) | Transport Layer Security (formerly and still known as Secure Sockets Layer) | For providing communication security over a network.
[TCP/IP](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) | Transmission Control Protocol, which compliments the Internet Protocol | Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network.
[FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) | File Transfer Protocol | For transmitting large files between computers.
[SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol | For transmitting electronic mail between computers.
[SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) | Secure Shell | A cryptographic (encrypted) network protocol to allow remote login and other network services to operate securely over an unsecured network.
[SFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol) | SSH/Secure File Transfer Protocol | For transferring files over SSH.

... etc.
